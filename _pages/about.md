Hi! I’m a researcher at the [SnT research center](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/), University of Luxembourg, working at the intersection of AI/ML and Cybersecurity, two fields I care about especially as they raise some very interesting challenges in tech today. 

My research focuses on making machine learning systems more robust, trustworthy, and secure against adversarial attacks. I’m particularly interested in high-stakes domains like malware detection, fraud prevention, and offensive content moderation, where even small vulnerabilities can lead to serious consequences. Lately, I’ve also been involved into synthetic data generation, especially for tabular datasets, exploring how to create useful and private data that supports real-world applications without compromising sensitive information.

If you’d like a quick overview, here’s a [5-minute pitch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD5uB0sp4Bo) where I share the motivation behind my work, the challenges involved, and what makes this research both exciting and necessary.

Before moving to Luxembourg for my PhD, where I’ve spent five very interesting and fulfilling years, I completed my Master’s degree at the [University of Tartu](https://ut.ee/en) in Estonia and my Bachelor's at the [University of Tirana](https://unitir.edu.al/eng/) in Albania, including a one-year exchange at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) in Norway.

If you're curious about secure and trustworthy ML, or how adversaries try to outsmart AI models (and how we fight back), feel free to reach out!
