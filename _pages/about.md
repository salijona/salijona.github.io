Hi! I’m a researcher at the [SnT research center](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/) (University of Luxembourg), working at the intersection of AI/ML and Cybersecurity. 

My research focuses on making AI/ML systems more secure and trustworthy, especially against adversarial attacks. I’m particularly interested in high-stakes domains like malware detection or fraud prevention, where small vulnerabilities can have serious consequences. Recently, I’ve also been exploring synthetic data for tabular datasets.

If you’d like a quick overview, here’s a [5-minute pitch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD5uB0sp4Bo) with the motivation, the challenges, and what makes this research both exciting and necessary.

Before moving to Luxembourg for my PhD,  I completed my Master’s at the [University of Tartu](https://ut.ee/en) in Estonia and my Bachelor's at the [University of Tirana](https://unitir.edu.al/eng/) in Albania, including a one-year exchange at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) in Norway.

Always happy to chat about adversarial threats and defenses in AI/ML, feel free to get in touch!
