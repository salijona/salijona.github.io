I am a post-doctoral researcher specializing in Adversarial Machine Learning working at [SnT research center](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/), University of Luxembourg.  

WIth my work I explore ways to make machine learning systems more secure and less vulnerable to malicious attacks. This includes researching techniques that can reveal security flaws and possible effective defenses. The main interest currently lie on robustness of ML for malware classification, text analysis and tabular data, in addition to Deep Generative Models for tabular data.
