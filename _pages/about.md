Hi! I’m a researcher at the [SnT research center](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/) (University of Luxembourg), working at the intersection of AI/ML and Cybersecurity. 

My research focuses on making machine learning systems more robust, trustworthy, and secure, especially against adversarial attacks. I’m particularly interested in high-stakes domains like malware detection or fraud prevention,  where small vulnerabilities can have serious consequences. Recently, I’ve also been exploring synthetic data generation for tabular datasets.

If you’d like a quick overview, here’s a [5-minute pitch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD5uB0sp4Bo) where I share the motivation behind my work, the challenges involved, and what makes this research both exciting and necessary.

Before moving to Luxembourg for my PhD, where I’ve spent five cool years, I completed my Master’s degree at the [University of Tartu](https://ut.ee/en) in Estonia and my Bachelor's at the [University of Tirana](https://unitir.edu.al/eng/) in Albania, including a one-year exchange at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) in Norway.

If you're curious about secure and trustworthy ML, or how adversaries try to outsmart AI models (and how we fight back), feel free to reach out!
